## Pomodoro-Timer

# About
This repository contains a link to a group course project I completed at UCSD. I cannot share the source code because the project is related to coursework and sharing could violate academic standards. However, I provide a link to our web app and some project details here. Please feel free to contact me with technical questions or to ask about my collaborators! This project would not be possible without them.

The project features a to-do list that integrates the pomodoro (tomato) method. This involves the user working on a task for a set interval of time with no distractions. After the interval is over, a short break is taken. After 4 intervals of work, a longer break is taken. This method is effective at improving work efficiency and improves focus. Read more about it [here](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique).

# Technical Details
As per project specifications, we used vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in developing the app. It features local storage, notifications, unit tests in Jest.js, end to end tests in Cypress, and flexible UI settings. There is an info section featured in the app for more details.

# My Involvement
I was a backend developer in charge of creating, integrating, and testing backend components. I designed the tasklist front and backend functionality, among other things, and wrote associated tests in Jest. I was also in charge of end to end testing with automated scripts in Cypress.

Feel free to check out our [Pomo Hero](https://pomo-hero.web.app/) app here. I hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed building it!
